# 🌍 Earthquake Analysis and Prediction System

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing historical earthquake data and predicting earthquake magnitude using machine learning techniques.

Earthquakes are natural disasters that cause massive loss of life and property. By studying past earthquake data, we can identify patterns such as:

- High-risk earthquake zones  
- Frequency of earthquakes  
- Relationship between depth and magnitude  
- Future magnitude trends  

This system uses **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models** to help understand earthquake behavior and support disaster risk management.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze historical earthquake data
- Clean and preprocess raw datasets
- Visualize earthquake trends and distributions
- Identify earthquake-prone regions
- Build a machine learning prediction model
- Predict earthquake magnitude using past records

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Although earthquake data is publicly available, it is rarely analyzed for meaningful insights.

Manual analysis is difficult due to:
- Large datasets
- Complex geographical patterns
- Lack of prediction models

This project solves the problem by providing:
- Automated data analysis
- Visual interpretation
- Machine learning–based magnitude prediction
